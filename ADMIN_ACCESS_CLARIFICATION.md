# 🔐 Admin Access - How It Works

## Current Setup (Correct ✅)

### Admin Access Flow:
```
1. Go to /backstage
2. Enter admin password (shared by internal team)
3. Access admin features at /admin/*
```

### Admin Features Available:
- `/admin/settlements` - Settlement monitoring dashboard
- Future: `/admin/kyb-approvals` - Approve banks/PSPs
- Future: `/admin/fee-config` - Configure fees
- Future: `/admin/users` - Manage users

---

## Who Are Admins?

**Admins = NedaPay internal team (you and co-founders)**

NOT the banks/PSPs! They have their own user accounts with scope BANK or PSP.

---

## Why Shared Password (Not Individual Accounts)?

### Current Approach:
- ✅ Simple for small team (1-5 people)
- ✅ Quick access for MVP/demo
- ✅ No complex setup needed
- ⚠️ No audit trail (can't track who did what)

### Later (When You Scale):
You may want to switch to individual admin accounts for:
- Audit trail (regulatory compliance)
- Revoke access when someone leaves
- Track who approved what

---

## What Was Removed

### ❌ Redundant Admin User Account
Previously created but unnecessary:
- Email: admin@nedapay.io
- Password: AdminTest123!
- Scope: ADMIN

**Why removed?**
- You already have `/backstage` password gate
- Individual admin accounts aren't needed yet
- Would create confusion about access methods

---

## Summary

**Admin Access Method:** Password-protected `/backstage` gate ✅

**Admin Features:** `/admin/settlements` and future admin pages ✅

**Admin User Accounts:** Not used (removed) ❌

**Banks/PSPs:** Have their own user accounts with BANK/PSP scope ✅

**This keeps it simple for your MVP while maintaining security! 🎯**
