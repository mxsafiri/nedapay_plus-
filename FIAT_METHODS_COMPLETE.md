## 🎯 What This Enables

### For Providers:
- ✅ Configure how they fulfill orders (M-Pesa, Thunes, banks)
- ✅ Multiple methods for flexibility
- ✅ Test Thunes connection before going live
- ✅ Update methods later if needed

### For Platform:
- ✅ Know which methods each provider supports
- ✅ Route orders to appropriate providers
- ✅ Track which method was used per order
- ✅ Provider diversity (not dependent on one method)

### For Settlement:
- ✅ Provider fulfills using their configured method
- ✅ Marks order complete with proof
- ✅ Gets settled in USDC automatically
- ✅ Complete audit trail

## 🔒 Security Notes

### Current Implementation:
- ⚠️ API keys stored in plain text (TODO: encrypt)
- ✅ Password field for API key input
- ✅ Separate endpoint for testing
- ✅ Data validation on save

### TODO for Production:
1. **Encrypt API Keys**
   - Use encryption library
   - Store encrypted in database
   - Decrypt only when needed

2. **Validate Thunes API**
   - Make real API call to Thunes
   - Verify credentials actually work
   - Handle API errors properly

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - Limit test connection attempts
   - Prevent brute force attacks

4. **Audit Logging**
   - Log when methods are changed
   - Track who made changes
   - Alert on suspicious activity

### What Works:
- ✅ Full UI component integrated
