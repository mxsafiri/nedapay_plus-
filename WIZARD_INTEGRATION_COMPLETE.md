## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Files Modified:

#### 1. **`components/settings/provider/provider-configurations.tsx`**
**Changes:**
- ✅ Added import for `WalletSetupWizard`
- ✅ Added `showWizard` state variable
- ✅ Added logic to detect if wallets are configured
- ✅ Added conditional rendering to show wizard when needed
- ✅ Added "Setup Guide" button in Wallet Addresses section
- ✅ Connected wizard completion to refresh configuration data

**Code:**
```typescript
// State management
const [showWizard, setShowWizard] = useState(false);

// Detection logic
const hasWalletsConfigured = networks.every(
  network => config.walletAddresses[network.identifier]?.trim().length > 0
);

// Conditional rendering
if (!hasWalletsConfigured || showWizard) {
  return (
    <WalletSetupWizard 
      userId={effectiveUserId}
      onComplete={() => {
        setShowWizard(false);
        fetchConfigurations();
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

#### 2. **`components/onboarding/index.ts`** ⭐ NEW
**Purpose:** Export file for cleaner imports
```typescript
export { WalletSetupWizard } from './wallet-setup-wizard';
```

## 🧪 HOW TO TEST

### Test Scenario 1: New PSP (No Wallets)
```bash
# 1. Create a new PSP account
# 2. Log in
# 3. Navigate to: http://localhost:3000/protected/settings
# 4. Click "Provider Configuration" tab
# 5. ✅ Wizard should appear automatically
```

**Expected Result:**
- Wizard displays with 3 steps
- Progress bar shows 33% → 66% → 100%
- Can enter Hedera Account ID (validates format)
- Can enter Base address (validates format)
- Review step shows both addresses
- Save button works and refreshes page

### Test Scenario 2: Existing PSP (Has Wallets)
```bash
# 1. Log in as PSP with configured wallets
# 2. Navigate to: http://localhost:3000/protected/settings
# 3. Click "Provider Configuration" tab
# 4. ✅ Normal config page should appear
# 5. Scroll to "Wallet Addresses" section
# 6. Click "Setup Guide" button
# 7. ✅ Wizard should appear
```

**Expected Result:**
- Normal page loads first (wizard doesn't show)
- "Setup Guide" button visible in wallet section
- Clicking button shows wizard
- After completing wizard, returns to normal page

### Test Scenario 3: Validation
```bash
# In wizard:
# 1. Try invalid Hedera ID: "123456" (missing 0.0.)
# 2. ✅ Should show error: "Invalid format"
# 3. Try valid: "0.0.7099612"
# 4. ✅ Should show green checkmark
# 5. Try invalid Base address: "742d35..." (missing 0x)
# 6. ✅ Should show error
# 7. Try valid: "0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb"
# 8. ✅ Should show green checkmark
```

## 💡 TIPS FOR SUPPORT TEAM

### When PSP Asks: "How do I set up wallets?"

**Response:**
```
"Great question! It's super easy:

1. Go to Settings → Provider Configuration
2. Our setup wizard will guide you through 3 simple steps
3. Takes about 10 minutes
4. No crypto knowledge needed!

Want me to walk you through it on a call?"
```

### When PSP Says: "I need to update my wallet address"

**Response:**
```
"No problem! Here's how:

1. Go to Settings → Provider Configuration
2. Scroll to 'Wallet Addresses' section
3. Click 'Setup Guide' button
4. Follow the wizard to enter new addresses

Or you can just type the new address directly in the input box."
```

### When PSP Says: "The wizard won't accept my address"

**Response:**
```
"Let's check the format:

For Hedera:
✅ Correct: 0.0.7099612
❌ Wrong: 7099612 or 0.7099612

For Base:
✅ Correct: 0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb
❌ Wrong: 742d35... (needs 0x at start)
❌ Wrong: Must be 42 characters total

Can you read me what you're entering?"
```

## 🎯 SUCCESS METRICS

Track these to measure wizard effectiveness:

### Completion Metrics:
- **Wizard Started:** PSPs who see wizard
- **Step 1 Completed:** Entered Hedera account
- **Step 2 Completed:** Entered Base address
- **Step 3 Completed:** Clicked save
- **Success Rate:** Step 3 / Wizard Started

**Target:** >85% completion rate

### Time Metrics:
- **Avg Time to Complete:** Target <15 minutes
- **Drop-off Points:** Where PSPs abandon
- **Support Ticket Rate:** Target <10%

### Quality Metrics:
- **Format Errors:** Invalid addresses submitted
- **Address Changes:** How often PSPs update
- **Manual Guide Usage:** "Setup Guide" button clicks

---

## 🐛 KNOWN ISSUES / LIMITATIONS

### Current Limitations:
1. **Manual Wallet Creation Required**
   - PSPs must create Hedera account manually
   - PSPs must install MetaMask manually
   - No automated wallet creation yet

2. **No Real-time Verification**
   - Wizard validates format only
   - Doesn't check if account exists on chain
   - Doesn't verify PSP owns the address

3. **Single Network Support**
   - Currently Hedera Testnet + Base Sepolia
   - Mainnet migration needed for production

### Future Improvements:
1. **Automated Wallet Creation**
   - Integrate Privy (when Hedera support added)
   - Or build custom wallet manager
   - Platform-managed custody option

2. **Real-time Verification**
   - Check account exists via API
   - Send test transaction ($0.01)
   - Require confirmation to proceed

3. **Multi-network Support**
   - Add mainnet networks
   - Support more chains
   - Dynamic network configuration
