# ⚙️ Settings-Based Profile Completion (Simplified Approach)

**Date**: October 21, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED

---

## 📝 Overview

Instead of separate onboarding pages, we're using the **existing Settings page** as the one-stop shop for users to complete their profiles. This is cleaner and more intuitive.
