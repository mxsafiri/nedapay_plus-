# ✅ NedaPay Settlement System - Implementation Complete

## 🎉 What We Built Today

### Core Settlement Infrastructure
- ✅ Database migration with settlement tracking
- ✅ Prisma schema updated with all settlement models
- ✅ Settlement service with auto-execution
- ✅ Retry logic for failed settlements
- ✅ Batch settlement processing

### Backend APIs (7 new endpoints)
1. ✅ `POST /api/provider/fulfill-order` - Auto-triggers settlements
2. ✅ `GET /api/dashboard/stats` - Includes settlement data
3. ✅ `GET /api/dashboard/settlements` - Settlement history
4. ✅ `GET /api/admin/settlements/status` - Admin monitoring
5. ✅ `POST /api/admin/settlements/retry` - Manual retry

### Frontend Updates
1. ✅ Provider Dashboard - Shows pending settlement amount
2. ✅ Admin Settlements Page - Full monitoring interface in Backstage
3. ✅ Admin Navigation - Added Settlements to sidebar

## 🎯 How It Works

### Flow Overview:

```
1. Provider fulfills order (fiat)
   ├─ M-Pesa: +255754123456
   ├─ Thunes API call
   └─ Bank transfer

2. Provider marks order "completed"
   └─ Provides transaction proof

3. Settlement auto-triggers
   ├─ Calculate: $100 reimbursement + $2 commission
   ├─ Send 102 USDC to provider's Hedera wallet
   └─ Update settlement status

4. Dashboards update
   ├─ Provider sees: "Pending: $0" (settled!)
   ├─ Admin sees: Settlement completed
   └─ Transaction logged
```
