# ✅ Setup Complete! NedaPay Settlement System

## 🎉 What Just Happened

We've successfully implemented the **settlement system** for NedaPay! Here's what's now working:

### ✅ Database Updates
- Added settlement tracking fields to `payment_orders` table
- Added fiat infrastructure to `provider_profiles` table
- Created settlement batch tables for tracking
- Updated Prisma schema and regenerated client

### ✅ Backend Services
- `lib/settlements/settlement-service.ts` - Core settlement logic
- `app/api/provider/fulfill-order/route.ts` - Auto-triggers settlements
- `app/api/dashboard/stats/route.ts` - Includes settlement data
- `app/api/dashboard/settlements/route.ts` - Settlement history API

### ✅ Frontend Updates
- Provider dashboard now shows "Pending Settlement" card
- Shows last settlement date
- Ready to add settlement history view

---

## 🚀 Testing the System

### 1. Start Your Dev Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2. Test Settlement Flow

**Option A: Via UI (Recommended)**
1. Log in as a provider
2. Go to order queue
3. Accept an order
4. Mark it as "completed" with transaction proof
5. Check logs - should see settlement triggered
6. Check dashboard - pending settlement should update

**Option B: Via Database**
1. Create a test order in your database
2. Assign it to a provider
3. Update status to 'completed'
4. Check logs for settlement execution

### 3. Verify Settlement

Check these things:
- ✅ Provider dashboard shows pending settlement amount
- ✅ Settlement transaction logged in `transaction_logs`
- ✅ USDC sent to provider's Hedera wallet (check blockchain)
- ✅ Order marked as `settlement_status: 'completed'`

---

## 📊 How It Works

### Flow Overview:

```
1. Provider fulfills order (fiat)
   ├─ Sends M-Pesa/Thunes/Bank transfer
   └─ Marks order "completed" with tx proof

2. Settlement triggered automatically
   ├─ Calculates: reimbursement + commission
   ├─ Sends USDC to provider's wallet
   └─ Updates settlement status

3. Dashboard updates
   ├─ Pending settlement decreases
   ├─ Total settled increases
   └─ Last settlement date updates
```

### Settlement Calculation:

```typescript
settlementAmount = order.amount_paid + order.psp_commission

Example:
- Order amount: $100
- Commission: $2
- Settlement: $102 USDC

Provider receives:
✅ $100 reimbursement (they paid recipient)
✅ $2 commission (their earnings)
= $102 total in USDC
```

---

## 🔍 Monitoring Settlements

### Check Settlement Logs:

```typescript
// In your backend logs, look for:
"💰 Starting settlement for order..."
"💵 Settlement breakdown:"
"   - Reimbursement: $100.00"
"   - Commission: $2.00"
"   - Total: $102.00 USDC"
"📤 Settling to provider wallet: 0.0.XXXXXX"
"✅ Settlement completed: 0.0.7099609@..."
```

### Check Database:

```sql
-- View settlements
SELECT 
  id,
  amount_paid,
  psp_commission,
  settlement_status,
  settlement_tx_hash,
  settled_at
FROM payment_orders
WHERE settlement_status = 'completed'
ORDER BY settled_at DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- View provider balances
SELECT 
  trading_name,
  pending_settlement_amount,
  total_settlements,
  last_settlement_date
FROM provider_profiles
WHERE pending_settlement_amount > 0;
```

## 🛠️ What's Next

### Immediate (This Week):

1. **Test settlements thoroughly**
   - Create multiple test orders
   - Verify USDC arrives in wallets
   - Check dashboard updates correctly

2. **Add Fiat Fulfillment Methods UI**
   - Create provider onboarding step for M-Pesa/Thunes config
   - Save to `fiat_infrastructure` field
   - Test configuration workflow

3. **Build Admin Settlement Monitoring**
   - Create `/protected/admin/settlements` page
   - Show pending/failed settlements
   - Add manual retry button

### Soon (Next Week):

4. **Integrate Thunes (or alternative)**
   - Create `lib/fiat/thunes-client.ts`
   - Test sandbox transactions
   - Add to fulfillment options

5. **End-to-End Testing**
   - Bank creates order → Provider fulfills → Settlement happens
   - Test all edge cases
   - Verify webhooks work

6. **Documentation**
   - Provider settlement guide
   - Bank integration guide
   - Admin playbook

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### TypeScript Errors?
```bash
npx prisma generate
npm run dev
```

### Settlement Not Triggering?
- Check provider has Hedera wallet configured
- Check order status is 'completed'
- Check logs for error messages
- Verify HEDERA_OPERATOR_ID and HEDERA_OPERATOR_KEY in .env

### Settlement Failing?
- Check provider's wallet address is valid
- Check NedaPay treasury has USDC balance
- Check blockchain connection
- View error in settlement_retry_queue table
